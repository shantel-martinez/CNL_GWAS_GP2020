Many headers have been renamed manually for ease, but the data was never edited manually unless noted below:

- for Snyder2012, there was a single record, PLOT 1251, with a missing Source number (which is actually GID in this case). Unfortunately it has a non unique entry name, NY07105-57.  This Entry name belongs to two GIDs, 721 and 761, according to the other two locations Helfer and Ketola, which have both entries. So, because Snyder2012 contained a GID 761 and not 721, I concluded that the missing GID # is 721.  I manually corrected the file by inputting 721 for the GID column of the NY07105-57 Entry (PLOT 1251).

- GID 330, Entry 96185 (PLOT 2230) in Helfer 2009 had a recorded heading date of 54, this was corrected to 5. Based on Golden, a variety very close in that field that headed on the 5th at Helfer, and both Golden and 96185-330 had the same heading date at McGowan. 


- GID 864, Entry NY05158, (PLOT 1135), has a heading date of 0 at Snyder 2014. Changed to 1 based on early value at Helfer
